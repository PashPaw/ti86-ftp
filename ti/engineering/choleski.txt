Instructions for TI-85, TI-86, TI-89 and TI-92:

For TI-85 and TI-86:

Choleski.85p and Choleski.86p are programs.
Run "Choleski" and it prompts for a matrix, A.
"Choleski" displays the factorized A-matrix
and pauses. Scroll around it with the arrow keys.
Press the "ENTER" key to quit. A copy of the
factorized matrix-A is stored in "UprM." A copy
of the A-matrix is stored in "AMat." See the
example below.

For TI-89 and TI-92

Choleski.89f and Choleski.92f are properly functions.
Call "Choleski" with a single argument: Choleski(A),
where "A" is the matrix you want to factorize. The
function returns the factorized matrix. Nothing is
stored by "Choleski". See example below.


EXAMPLE:

The A-matrix must be positive-definite symmetric,
or positive-definite Hermitian to work with this
algorithm. (A positive definite matrix is one that
has all eigenvalues greater than zero.) Always check
the properties of the results from "Choleski." The 
properties are:

  A = Transpose[U] * U , or, A = H[U] * U (when A is Hermitian)
  U is an upper triangular matrix
  The square of the product of the leading diagonal of U = Det(A)

where U is the Choleski decomposition of A, and
A is the positive definite symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix.

Let A = [[2 3 4][3 6 7][4 7 10]]

Passing A to "Choleski" returns the decomposition,

[[1.41421 2.12132 2.82843]
 [0 1.22474 0.8165]
 [0 0 1.1547]]

Assuming the result is stored to the variable UprM,
then,

Transpose[UprM] * UprM = A
