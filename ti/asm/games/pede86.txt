        This software was written by myself for fun and is not a product of TI.
        Anyone who wishes to load this game and play it is free to do so.

        Much of game decription was borrowed from the Atari(tm) Centepede
        game manual for the Atari 5200.


                         GAME PLAY
                         ---------

                         ASM(pede)

                         You start the game with three wands. Every
                      time you score 12,000 points, you earn another.
                      When you lose your last wand, the game ends.

                         If the centipede, spider, or flea bites you, your
                      wand lost. All of the mushrooms you partially destroyed
                      are restored. Your points are added to your
                      running score, and the rejuvenated centipede attacks
                      again from the top. You must replay the previous
                      wave until the centipede is totally destroyed.

                      OBJECTIVE 

                         Use your wands to score as many points as
                      possible.

                      ENEMIES
                      -------

                      CENTEPEDE
                      ---------

                         Consisting of 12 body segments, the centipede attacks
                      from the top of the screen and winds down toward
                      you. Each time you hit a segment, it becomes
                      a powerless mushroom and the body segment behind
                      that mushroom becomes the head of a new centipede.
                      When you shoot every segment of a centipede, your
                      score is shown and you advance to the next attack wave.

                         The centipede attacks in 12 distinct waves. In
                      Wave 1, the centipede is composed of a head
                      attached to 11 body parts. In Wave 2. it has a head
                      attached to 10 body parts plus a detached head. The
                      Wave 3 centipede is composed of 9 body segments
                      with one head attached and 2 detached heads. The
                      centipede continues to transform a body segment
                      into a head until Wave 12 when it has 12
                      independently moving heads.

                         The first 3 waves should be quite easy for most
                      players.
                         Every 3rd wave your enemies ability to attack you
                      is increased.


                      MAGIC MUSHROOMS
                      ---------------

                         Dotting the forest floor are magic mushrooms.
                      These act like shields for you and can speed the
                      centipede in its attack. The centipede slides along
                      horizontally in one direction. When it gets to a
                      mushroom or the edge of the screen, it turns down
                      to the next row of mushrooms and continues in the
                      opposite direction. It takes three hits to eliminate
                      an entire mushroom. At the end of each wave, all
                      partially destroyed mushrooms are magically
                      restored to the forest. 

                      SPIDER
                      ------

                         In its attempt to distract you from shooting the
                      centipede, the spider jumps all over the
                      battlefield, eliminating some of the mushrooms it
                      touches. The closer the spider comes, the more
                      points you score when you hit it.

                      FLEA
                      ----

                         The flea starts bugging you after you shoot away
                      most of the mushrooms near you. It drops straight
                      down, creating mushrooms as it falls. You must hit
                      the flea 3-5 times to make it disappear.

                      Warning: After the first shot, the flea drops more
                      than twice as fast!

                      CONTROLS
                      --------

                      [2nd]   = fire
                      [<-]    = move wand left
                      [->]    = move wand right
                      [exit]  = quit game and return to homescreen
                      [enter] = pause, it can be sticky, tap quickly

                      After score is displayed press a key to resume game.


                      There is no 'High Score' screen in version 1.0, I
                      am thinking of adding it.
