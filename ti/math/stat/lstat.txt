List Statistics

Comments welcomed. Attitudes are not.

A program to produce some statistical data from a list stored in the TI-86. The program 
calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, frequency and relative distributions, and 
a histogram. LStat redimentions and updates the following built-in lists on the TI-86: 
fStat, xStat, and yStat. If also creates a new list named lStat for use in its 
computations.

Limitations
LStat is designed to work with lists that contain 128 elements of less. This is due to the 
number of lines available for display on the calculator itself. Further lists containing 
elements smaller than .001 may not behave properly.

Example Data
The baseball data below, taken from the second month of the 1996 season, is used to 
illustrate the operation of LStat.

	Team		% of Games Won	Batting Average	Pitching ERA	
	Atlanta		66			0.277			2.75	
	San Diego		63			0.273			3.22	
	Montreal		57			0.275			3.95	
	Los Angeles		53			0.242			2.95	
	San Francisco	52			0.261			4.83	
	Colorado		51			0.283			5.90	
	Philadelphia	50			0.236			4.39	
	Florida		50			0.241			3.80	
	Houston		50			0.270			4.02	
	St. Louis		44			0.266			4.70	
	New York		42			0.265			4.40	
	Cincinnati		42			0.244			5.04	
	Chicago		41			0.247			4.60	
	Pittsburgh		38			0.252			4.69	



Running LStat
The first input required from you is that of the name of the list containing the data to 
process.

Once entered, LStat will ask you if the list consists of the population or a sample. 

The TI-86 will then display the following: range, summation of the elements, number of 
elements, the mean, variance, and standard deviation. You are then asked if you want 
to see the table or quit.

Choose table to continue and the calculator displays its calculations for the number of 
classes and the interval between classes. It further displays the minimum and maximum 
values in the list. At this point press continue to see the actual table.

As the calculator cycles through the list, it displays dynamically the changing values 
until such time that all elements are processed. The table consists of three columns: The 
lower limit of the class, the frequency of the class, and the relative frequency of the 
class. It further displays the summation of the frequency and the relative frequency.

Pressing Histogram will have the TI-86 display the histogram associated with your list

Of course, anytime you see the option to Quit, the program will terminate at that point.

Once the TI-86 has displayed the graph, you can flip back and forth between the graph 
and the table by pressing the EXIT and GRAPH keys alternately. When done, press the 
EXIT key until the graph disappears from the screen, then press the CLEAR key to clear 
the display.
