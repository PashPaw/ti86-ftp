EVOLUTION by Sam Nejad

Evolution 1 is probably the only program of it's type for any graphic
calculator. It is useful for teaching evolution in biology, for teaching
statistics, and as a fun program. You enter any word or phrase (all capital
letters) including spaces, commas, question marks and full stops. The phrase
can be up to a thousand characters long. The word or phrase you enter is the
environment into which the calculator develops a creature of the same
spelling, using random cumalitive mutation. Every time the correct character
(gene) is found it is inherited by the next generation. Unsuitable
characters (genes) perish and are replaced at random. Eventually the
creature fits the enviroment exactly, and the number of generations it took
is displayed. This is an ideal example of cumulative mutation as described
by Richard Dawkins in "The Blind Watchmaker". Those who graph the number of
generations on the Y axis against the length of the word or phrase on the X
axis will notice that as the phrase gets longer, the number of generations
gradually levels out!
