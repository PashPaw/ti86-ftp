ANG.86p  Angle conversions converts degrees to radians to 
gradians in any direction.  

ANGLE1.86p  Angle is a short program that gives the sine, 
cosine, tangent, cosecent, secent, and cottangant for any 
angle in degrees.

ANGLE2.86p  Angle Drawer is a program I wrote to draw angles.  
It helps if you need to know what quadrant an angle is in, 
or what it looks like, or what some points on the line.  
It takes the angle in Degrees, Radians, Gradians, or Points.

SINE.86p  Law of sines uses the law of signs to find a side 
or an angle if you are given an angle, the side opp it, and 
another angle, or a side, the angle opp it, and another angle.

SOLUTION.86p Number of solutions tells you the number of 
solutions for a triangle that has givens of one angle and 
two consecutive sides. (SSA).
