This is my version of Michael Lloyd's Polyn program. The main difference is
that mine has a nicer partial fraction decomposition format, and is
smaller. Michael Lloyd  gave me full permission to distribute this program as long
as my email address went with (bevd@bellsouth.net) and not his, so that
he wouldn't be bohtered with the email.

HERE IS THE ORIGINAL INFORMATION WHICH STILL APPLIES
This version uses the built-in reduced echelon form instead of
doing maximal column pivoting.  This, and some other changes
reduced the size of the program by about .5Kb.  The speed of the
partial fraction routine also increased.

Multiply, divide, exponentiate, graph, do partial
fractions (p.f.), differentiate, and integrate polynomials.

Except for the partial fractions, the polynomials and power are entered
under the INPUT menu.  Polynomials are entered and displayed as lists.
For example, x^3-4x+7 would be {1,0,-4,7}.  The braces {} are under the
LIST menu (although you can put them in the custom menu).
