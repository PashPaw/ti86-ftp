Introducing the newest Taylor program (as of 10-13-98) 
by William Deich

It's not just based on the TI-86 manual any more.

The group file contains 5 files
-------------------------------
AGRAF.85p--sets graph
NDERIV.85p--allows you to take the nth derivative of any function
subderiv.85p--does the actual work for the higher derivatives
TAYLOR.85p--Creates Taylor approx polynomial
ZZSTORE.85p--allows you to enter a function and store it to y1-y5
[used by AGRAF and TAYLOR]


--Improvements over the manual version--

This version pauses while displaying ths Taylor 
Polynomial as a list of Coeff in descending order.

This new version has the command lines that figure out 
the higher order derivatives (>3) seperated out
into a seperate subrutene called subderiv, which means 
that it can be used by other programs to approximate 
an nth derivative. I've included a program called 
NDERIV.85p to do just that.

The group file also includes a program called
ZZSTORE.85p which alows you to enter a function
and store it to y1-y5.

The group file also includes AGRAF to let you set the
Graph Window before you graph the function and its
taylor approximation.
----------------------------------------------------
For all those who may be asking, A Taylor Polynomial 
is a way of approximating a hard to calculate function 
with a polynomial by making sure that the derivates 
of the new poylynomial agrees with the function's 
derivatives at some point near where you want to
approximate; it used to be a big deal before computers,
now you'll probably never need it unless you just happen
to be on the particular chapter in you calculus book
that covers this. ---- Nevertheless, you may want to 
use the NDERIV program since the TI-86 only comes w/
1st and 2nd derivatives built in.
