The two programs were written in the basic language.  Cambio.86p is a foreign 
currency exchange program.  The user can choose from five fixed rates or 
they can put in their own rates. (This was done because the exchange rates 
are always changing.)  The user then can choose to convert the US dollar to 
another currency or another currency to the US dollar.  The program 
Install.86p is a program that just declares the needed variables for 
Cambio.86p.  Once the user runs Install.86p and it set the variables, they 
(Note: They can delete it IF they do not delete the variables.)  Creating 
Install.86p was a small attempt at making Cambio.86p a bit smaller

change
------

the percentage of change when the user
knows the "before" value and the "after"
value.

primec
------
PrimeC v1.0

This program is based on an idea by Charles J. Srstka in the program
Prime uploaded to the TI-83 Basic Math directory sometime in -97: 
The number investigated is divided by a whole list of potential prime-
factors. This way many operations can be carried out in the same time
as only one in the conventional program, by the built in list functions.
The factor in this case is counted up by the sequense in Erathostenes
sieve from 7 to 37. The numbers are listed to L1, wich is counted up
by 30 each time. This makes the program run in about a third of the ti-
me for the conventional program.

The primefactors found are displayed and then listed to L2 as the pro-
gram goes forth.When X is 144 it should look like this:

X=?144

                    2
                    2
                    2
                    2
                    3
                    3
the window is then cleared and the result is displayed,

                  144
      
                    6
        {2 2 2 2 3 3}

prlist
------
PrList v1.0 for the TI-86.
By Anders Tiberg, original concept by Charles J. Srstka.

Three months ago I found a program, uploaded as Prime by
Charles J. Srstka, in the TI-83 Basic Math directory, that had an in-
teresting concept. To produce a list of primenumbers the number
that was investigated was divided with the list itself, starting from
two counting odd numbers from three.If the numbers in the resulting
list all have a fraction part, the number is a prime and is added to the
list. This gives an absolute minimum to produce the primes from two
and on. The drawback is that you are using to many numbers in the
list; you only have to use the primes onto the squareroot of the num-
ber investigated. So I wrote a program with two lists according to
that idea. The increase in speed was awesome. The reason is that
the built in list functions are now favorably used to carry out many
operations in the same time as only one in the conventional program.

Since this was not my idea from the beginning, I sent the program to
Charles, asking if he wanted to upload it as an update to the original.
He offered me that we should upload it in both our names. He also
added a feature to the program that made it possible to get the primes
within a given interval, wich caused me to enter a week long session
of revisions of a program with three lists. The TI-83 can't handle the
command 1+ dimL unless the list specified has at least one number.
Charles suggested that I'd use {0}->L3 and then P->L3((L3(1)>0)+
dimL(L3)) thus overwriting the first element in L3. This is a very useful
thing about the TI-83 wich goes for the TI-86 as well. The program
was finally uploaded june 13 to the TI-83 Basic Math directory.

So this program has simply been converted from the TI-83 to the
TI-86.I have tried it out for some time now, so it should bee bug free.
The idea is that you give an interval:

Min?50
Max?100

                      10
{53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97}

the slope and Y-intercept of the line going thru the points, and graphs the line.

any number, factor any number, give the vertex of a quadratic equation, and graph your equation.

quadform
--------

B, and C and the program will give you the anwers to the equasion, the vertex, and it will graph the 
equasion if you tell it to.

quadsm
------
This program is a smaller version of 'quad' that only works out the quadratic formula.

radical
-------
This program simplifies radical expressions.

radred
------
Radred v1.0 
This program is next of kin to the primefactorprogram. Because of
the limitation in the information it gives, it can be made much faster,
for most integers, than its relative. This version reduces a squareroot
of an integer. There is a subroutine; Radsub, that needs to be down-
loaded as well. The program is, most of the times, unbelievably fast,
you're going to think it's a joke but it isn't. When N is promted enter
a positive or negative integer.
