----------------------------------------------
This Program will handle all conic sections,
general & standard, rotated & nonrotated!

Master Menu:
|Input| All |Stop|info|GRAPH|

After you enter a conic by pressing F1, you can:
press F4 to get the center, foci, vertacies, etc 
in both the xy- and x'y'-coordinate systems! You
are also given the Latus Rectum/Major & Minor axis
length, etc.

Basically, everything you could want to know about
the points on a conic section.

   Or you can press F5 and graph the conic, EVEN IF
IT'S ROTATED!

   Or you can press F2 and first see the info, and
then graph!

Yes, this program does just about everything but
wash your socks (never!), handle 3D conics (kind of 
hard) or give you the directracies for ellipses  and 
hyperbolas (but I don't know anybody that uses those
anyway!).

The program is very self expanitory. The "biggest"
drawback is that it takes up about 5400 bytes. However,
I think that it's a program well worth making room for,
especially since it can do most of your conic section
work for you! (Just delete some of those games when
you're in math class)

Quirks and Warnings: (This is nothing to be afraid of.)
-------------------------------------------------------
1A) In order to get a really good picture of the conic
sections, the programs graphs in Parametric mode.
	Most of you probably haven't even heard of Parametric
	Equations, unless you've had a VERY good Analitic
	Geometry/Precalculus class or you're in Calculus II.
	[[It's a system where both x and y are expressed as 
	seperate equations of a third variable, usually t.]]
Anyway, conic sections just happen to come out VERY NICE
if you graph them is this mode.

Also, Trace is a little weird in this mode. You're
moving to higher vaules of t, not x and the cursor 
often goes in the opposite direction than the arrow
key you press. (Just play around with it.)


1B) For your convience the angles are entered, and stored
in Degree mode, but for graph to work, the calculator
must be in Radian mode. The mode is only permently
changed on your calculator when you graph.

The program can't change back to whatever modes you were
in before the program started after graphing, because
you might want to look at the graph a little while
longer, or you might want to adjust the graph settings
to get a better look at the specific conic section.

ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW, IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN
PRESS [2ND] "MODE" TO PUT BACK THE SETTINGS TO WHATEVER
GRAPH MODE & ANGLE MODE YOU HAD BEFORE.

2) The program is so big, that if you try to edit it
on the calculator, you will probably alter a command
line by mistake, and never be able to find it again.
Also, it will take a long time run the 1st time it's
run, and each time after it's edited.

If you get an ERROR it's probably 'cause you entered
something wrong. Just press Quit and start over.
(If any of you do find a real error, pleas let me know
at williamiv@geocities.com)


3) If the center/vertex is at (0,0) you will see:

CENTER(x'y')
		(0,0)
and then it will go on to whatever's next.

This is because the program 1st figures out the
coordinates in terms of (x',y') [the rotated axies] 
and then translates them over to x & y.

If the center is at (0,0) then this rotation doesn't
make any difference, and the program doesn't waste time
giving you the same point twice.

Warnings:
---------

1) When entering a Standard Conic, be sure to know the
differnce between r^2 and r, A^2 and A, B^2 and B,
-H and H, and -K and K, and 4p and p.

2) When entering a Standard Ellipse, A must always be
bigger than B.

3) If you try to make up general conics at random
you will probably get errors, since most random
numbers will not satifly the equation
Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0. I recommend consulting
a math book for equations.


THIS PROGRAM IS SO GOOD, I BET NONE OF YOU ANYWERE,
ANY TIME WILL EVER BE ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT.
HOWEVER, SINCE IMPROVEMENTS ARE ALWAYS GOOD FOR 
THE ONLINE-TI COMMUNITY, I DARE ANY OF YOU TO TRY!
