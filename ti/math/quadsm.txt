This is the newest version of Quadsm.86p (Quad small) by William Deich
(bevd@bellsouth.net) and J Boylan (JBoylan@Technologist.com).

You give it A B and C of Ax^2+Bx+C and it graphs the function and 
displays the quadratic formula all worked out on the graph screen. 
(This part comes form J Boylan's Algebra II ToolBox.) It also displays 
a few other things on the graph screen. Press enter, and it gives you the 
roots in decimal form and the vertex.
