VERSION HISTORY

1.0 CONIC.85G Group of 6 programs I found on my professor's TI-85.
    They were only for hyperbolas, ellipses and parabolas in
    standard form.  DIDN'T HANDLE ROTATIONS.

2.0 FIRST GRAND UNIFIED CONIC SECTION PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    Total re-write.  Could handle ANY CONIC SECTION! ROTATED OR 
    NON-ROTATED! STANDARD OR GENERAL!!!  Size = 5399 bytes


3.0 GRAND UNIFIED CONIC SECTION PROGRAM XV2 (Experimental Version 2)
    Efficiency changes to save 704 bytes.  (UNRELEASED)

4.0 GRAND UNIFIED CONIC SECTION PROGRAM SUPER VERSION 3!--THIS VERSION
    More efficiency changes, including linear algebra algorathims
    to save another 497 bytes.
---------------------------------------------------

I call this program the Grand Unified Conic Program
because it will handle all conic sections,
General & Standard, Rotated & NonRotated!!!!!!!!!!!
Hallelujah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Master Menu:
|Input| All |Stop|info|GRAPH|

IF you press F3 for Stop it will
execute an actual Stop command.
There is also a Stop command at
the end of the program.  THIS IS
TO ESCAPE FROM ASSEMBLY SHELLS.


IF you press F1 you are given the
Input Menu:

|Gener|Stand|Windo|    | <- |

IF you press F3 for WINDOW it will
Prompt xMin,xMax,xScl,yMin,yMax,yScl

      ---warning---
This program graphs all conic sections
in Parametric Mode to get a good graph.

In order for these values to be stored
to the RANGE settings of the Parametric
Graph Screen, the program puts the
calculator in Parametric Mode just before
it prompts you for the range variables.
      --------------

Input Menu:
|Gener|Stand|Windo|    | <- |

If you press F1 for General it will display

Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0 and then

Prompt A,B,C,D,E,F

Then it will compute A' C' D' E' & Theata

Then it will display Theata and ask
you if you want to change it!!!!!!

I've never even seen a problems that
asked for this before, but I decided
to throw it in for free anwyay!!!!!!

AFTER THIS IT WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MASTER MENU.


Input Menu:
|Gener|Stand|Windo|    | <- |

On the other hand you can press F2 to enter
a standard conic section!

This version of the program has a new Menu-Screen to
let you enter standard conics more efficiently!!!!!!

Basically you will see this on the screen...

1:x2Parab 2:y2Parab
3:X-Ellip 4:Y-Ellip
5:X-Hyper 6:Y-HYper
7:Circle?

You simply enter the number for the type of conic
you want to enter!!!

This and other changes save 704 bytes!!!

If you choose 1 or 2 for a Parabola it will
ask for H,K,p,Theata

If you choose 3->6 for any kind of Ellipse
or Hyperbola it will ask for H,K,A,B,Theata

If you choose 7 for Circle, it will ask for H,K,r

[Theata makes no difference for a circle!!!!!]

x2Parab = X^2 parabola
y2Parab = Y^2 parabola

X-Ellip = Ellipse with major axis parallel to X-axis
          --Tf it's NOT rotated
X-Ellip = Ellipse with major axis parallel to Y-axis
          --If it's NOT rotated

X-Hyper = A hyperbola with it's tranverse 
	axis parallel to the X-axis
        Said another way, it's one that 
	opens left and right
        --Provided that it's NOT rotated

Y-Hyper = A hyperbola with it's tranverse 
	axis parallel to the Y-axis
        Said another way, it's one that 
	opens up and down
        --Provided that it's NOT rotated

Circle - Well, you should know.


Master Menu:
|Input| All |Stop|info|GRAPH|

If you press F4 for "info" it will give you the
INFORMATION for the conic section

If you press F5 for "GRAPH" it will graph the
conic section in Parametric Mode.  This is because
conic sections on the TI-85/6 come out much nicer
in Parametric Mode than in Function Mode. This is
Because the use of Trig formulas for conic sections
allows for much smoother graphing without any gaps
in the middle or anything.

If you press F2 for "ALL" it will first give you the
information, and then graph it.

------------------------------------------------------


The "biggest" drawback of this program is still
it's size.  

VERSION 1 = 1950 BYTES

VERSION 2 = 5399

VERSION 3 = 4695

VERSION 4 = 4198

The first version was a lot smaller but did a lot less.
I still think it's worth having, JUST DELETE A FEW OF
THOSE GAMES!!!


ODD LITTLE THINGIES :)
-------------------------------------------------------
0) This version displays the points as [x y] instead of
   (x,y) since I used matrix*vector multiplication
   from Linear Algebra.  HOPE THIS ISN'T TOO CONFUSING :O)

1A) In order to get a really good picture of the conic
sections, the programs graphs in Parametric mode.

Most of you probably haven't even heard of Parametric
Equations, unless you've had a VERY good Analitic
Geometry/Precalculus class or you're in Calculus II.
--It's a system where both x and y are expressed as 
seperate equations of a third variable, usually t.

Anyway, conic sections just happen to come out VERY NICE
if you graph them is this mode.

Also, Trace is a little weird in this mode. You're
moving to higher vaules of t, not x and the cursor 
often goes in the opposite direction than the arrow
key you press. (Just play around with it.)


1B) For your convience the angles are entered, 
and stored in Degree mode, but it graphs in 
radian mode, SO WHEN YOU'RE DONE GRAPHING A
CONIC SECTION YOUR CALCULATOR WILL STILL BE
IN RADIAN MODE.

ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW, IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU CAN
PRESS [2ND] "MODE" TO PUT BACK THE SETTINGS TO WHATEVER
GRAPH MODE & ANGLE MODE YOU HAD BEFORE.

2) The program is so big, that if you try to edit it
on the calculator, you will probably alter a command
line by mistake, and never be able to find it again.
Also, it will take a long time run the 1st time it's
run, and each time after it's edited.

If you get an ERROR it's probably because you entered
something wrong. Just press Quit and start over.
(If any of you do find a real error, pleas let me know
at williamiv@geocities.com)


3) If the center/vertex is at (0,0) you will see:

CENTER(x'y')
		(0,0)
and then it will go on to whatever's next.

This is because the program 1st figures out the
coordinates in terms of (x',y') [the rotated axies] 
and then rotates them over to x & y.

If the center is at (0,0) then this rotation doesn't
make any difference, and the program doesn't waste time
giving you the same point twice.

4) To graph parabolas properly, the program 
   changes the Param window settings to
   (xMin->tMin, xMax->tMax, 1->tStep).

   The program resets the normal settings
   (0->tmin, 2pi-tMax, pi/24)
   when it graphs an ellipse/hyperbola/circle, 
   but must leave it this way while the parabola
   is displayed. To get back to "normal" you
   can use ZStd in Parametric Mode.

5) As always with the TI-85/TI-86 if you get a value like:
   -4.1382E-11 it really means zero.  This number means
   -4.1382*10^-11, and is simply due to round off error
   on the calculator.

SO if you see a points like
	(-5,1.8320E-12)
	(5,1.8320E-12)
Please understand this means
	(-5,0)
	(5,0)

6) Version 2.0 uses higher mathmatical concepts
   (including mod(FLAG(2),2) and IF-THEN-ELSE-END's)
   So it is a little harder to understand.
   Feel free to email me if you need help.


Warnings (This is nothing to be afraid of):
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) When entering a Standard Conic, be sure to know the
differnce between r^2 and r, A^2 and A, B^2 and B,
-H and H, and -K and K, and 4p and p.

2) When entering a Standard Ellipse, A must always be
bigger than B.

3) If you try to make up general conics at random
you will probably get errors, since most random
numbers will not satifly the equation
Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0. I recommend consulting
a math book for equations.


Yes, this program does just about everything but
wash your socks (never!), handle 3D conics (kind of 
hard) or give you the directracies for ellipses  and 
hyperbolas (but I don't know anybody that uses those
anyway!).

THIS PROGRAM IS SO GOOD, I BET NONE OF YOU ANYWERE,
ANY TIME WILL EVER BE ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT.
HOWEVER, SINCE IMPROVEMENTS ARE ALWAYS GOOD FOR 
THE ONLINE-TI COMMUNITY, I DARE ANY OF YOU TO TRY!
