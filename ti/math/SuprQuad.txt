suprquad
--------
Introducing Super Quadratic Formula program 4.1!

--Version inf0--
4.0 First release.

4.1 Few minor changes to Quad.86p, including a
name change to QdGrF on the calc, and to
QuadGraF.86p on the computer.

THIS PROGRAM IS INCREADIBLE! THIS PROGRAM IS INCREADIBLE

Transfer SuperQuad.86g to your calc
(Hopefully not thru typing, but this is possible if 
necessary)

SuprQuad.86g contans 5 files.
----------------------------
SuprQuad.86p
QdGrF.86p
COMPSQR.86p
subfrac.86p
zzrat.86p	[subfrac and zzrat are subrutenes]
Now there are a lot of files here, you can run most
of the programs by themselves. So if you want, you 
can just take the ones you like and delete the rest.
 
If you choose to do this, remember that
COMPSQR uses subfrac, and you may want zzrat for one 
of your own programs to reduce a square root. (It 
is also used by one of my programs called PTLINE.)

SuprQuad is just a menu program that ties everything
together.


Run SuprQuad and you get an introduction message and
the following menu: 

|Super|'sqrt'N|COMP|Vert|Stop|
You can also run the other programs seperately from this
menu

Press F1 for "Super" and you will get Y10(x)=

You enter the function AS IT REALLY LOOKS!
		(e.g. 5x^2+5x+5)

The calculator figures out what A,B & C are based on
Calculus.

The calculator will then graph the function,
and give you the following information off to the side
-----------------------------------------------------
Quadratic formual with the discriminant simplifies

X1 & X2 as decimals

the Vertex to 3 decimal places

The Completed Square [A(x-H)^2 +K]
	with -H ank K out to 3 decimal places

(the restrictions on decimal places are because there is
only so much room on the graph screen. If you need more
acuracy, you can also do these options on the home 
screen using other menu options.)


|Super|'sqrt'N|COMP|Vert|Stop|

Press F2 for 'sqrt'N and the calc will run zzrat 
to let you reduce the square root of any number you
give it (including negatives!)

The only reason zzrat is a seperate program is so that
it can act as a subrutene for as many different programs
as I want it to. In fact you can use it as a subrutene
for any of your programs out there in cyberspace.


|Super|'sqrt'N|COMP|Vert|Stop|

Press F3 and the calculator will run the COMPSQR program
This program Completes the Square in Ax^2+Bx+C and even 
converts to fractions! (That's what subfrac's for; you 
can't use the >Frac command in Outpt( commands.)
	As long as A, B and C are integers or RATIONAL 
decimals subfrac should be able to convert everything 
fractions [A in A(x-H)^2 +K is left as a decimal since
you probably already know what this is].

COMPSQR prompts for A,B & C like "normal."


|Super|'sqrt'N|COMP|Vert|Stop|
Press F4 and it will prompt A,B,C and then display
the vertex as fractions. This and F5 are the only menu
options that don't call up seperate programs.


|Super|'sqrt'N|COMP|Vert|Stop|
F5 executes a stop command.

Some of these programs are edit locked, but they don't 
have to stay that way; you can move the big scroll bar
on the TI-86 Graph link down and then "unclick" Protect.
