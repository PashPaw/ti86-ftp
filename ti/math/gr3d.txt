This is GR3D.86g by William Deich. I basically took John P. Powers' 
GR3D.85g program and updated it for the TI-86.

If anyone out there in cyberspace has any idea how I
could get in touch w/ Mr. Powers, please drop me a
line at bevd@bellsouth.net

This program plots a three-dimensional graph with 
hidden line removal.

The main difference between this version and 
John Powers' version for the 85 is that I gave the
program its own input commands, so you no longer have
to edit the program to change the function you are
graphing, or the range variables.

This group only contains two files:
-----------------------------------
GR3D.86p--main program
PLOT3D.86p--Wright's hidden-line removal algorithm (made by Mr. Powers)


Run GR3D form the home screen, and you will get a menu like:
|z(xy)|view|Range|GRID|Graph|

Press [ F1 ] and you can enter a fuction in terms x & y. The functin is
stored to y99. I don't think this should overwrite any of your existing
functions. All of the functions are deselected, including this one, so
this doesn't cause any errors.

Press [ F2 ] for "view" and it will ask you for the x,y,z coordinates
for "view point of the observer." Basically, where would you like to
view the graph from. [Default is (2,1,1)]

Press [ F3 ] and you can adjust the x-y range. Basically you enter values for
XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX. [Default is XMIN=-2.5, XMAX=2.5, YMIN=-2.5, YMAX=2.5]

Press [ F4 ] and you can enter the "Grid density," basically, how far do you
want the little lines to be apart. I suggesting never using this, and leaving
it on the Default of 10. According to John Powers, values larger than 11 
start to clutter up the screen, and smaller values run faster, but are less
accurate.

You don't ever have to press F2-F4 because they have defaults, but you will 
probably want to sometimes, to get a better look at your graph.

|Graph| graphs. If you try to press this w/out entering a function, it will
ask you to enter one first.

A WORD ABOUT Z^2 or |Z| EQUATIONS.
---------------------------
Now I understand that many equations
involve Z^2 or |Z|. Some people might
want there to be an option to select
z^2=+-, or z=+-. I chose not to make
such an option because it would be 
much longer, and the program runs 
slow enough as it is. What I did instead
was to give you the option of whether
or not to clear what is drawn on the
graph or not. This way you can go back
and draw the equation piece by piece.



Now in the origional program, Mr. Powers had it so that  you had to edit a 
subrutene to enter your functions, and he put several sample equation in 
the subrutene to get you started; since this version just uses an InpSt
command to let you type the expression in as a string,  and then converts 
it to an equation, I guess I'll just have to give you his list of sample
function here in the text file.


EQ1:  z = cos |x+y*i|
      XMIN=-7, XMAX=7, YMIN=-7, YMAX=7
      Radians mode.


EQ2:  z = e^-|x-1+y*i| + e^-|x+1+y*i|
      XMIN=-2.5, XMAX=2.5, YMIN=-2.5, YMAX=2.5

EQ3**: z = R - sqrt(1-(x^2+y^2)),	if norm [x,y,R] < 1.
	  		       0,	otherwise.
      XMIN=-1.2, XMAX=1.2, YMIN=-1.2, YMAX=1.2
      This creates a depression in the plane z=0 by pressing a sphere
      into its surface.  Where R is a fraction between 0 and 1 which
      indicates the depth that a unit radius sphere is pressed into
      the plane.

EQ4:  z = e^-|x+y*i|
      XMIN=-1.2, XMAX=1.2, YMIN=-1.2, YMAX=1.2

**You will have to go back to the subrutene editing method if you want to use
EQ3, because it is a piece wise function.
