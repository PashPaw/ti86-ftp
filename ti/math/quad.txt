quad
----

This is the latest version of my Quad program. You give it A B and C and it
will work out the quadratic formula for you and simplify the discriminant
(the part with the square root). It will also give you the vertex of a
parabola, reduce the square root of any number you give it, and factor any
number you give it.

The group file QUAD.86G contains three programs: Quad, Rat, and Fctr.

Special Thanks to J Boylan for letting me borrow a faster, more efficient
way
to reduce the square roots.

If you have any questions, or find any problems, especially with the square
roots come out, email me at
