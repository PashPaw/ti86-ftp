Programmer's Comments:
  I, when browsing through the "Program Archive" at www.TI.com, found
a program whose name caught my attention: "Key."  I looked at the
description, and found that it was a program to display the keycode or
any key when pressed.  At the bottom of it, there was a note telling
that the programmer was having some difficulty with a few extras he
thought about adding, but couldn't get them to work.
  I, after having a TI-83 for a few months, had taught myself to
program in TI-BASIC (with the grace of having an equal, or almost equal
, competitor [almost equal, for he was more into programming games,
while I was better at, and supported for, programming utilities and
useful programs (i.e. prgmQUADAUQ [pronounced: pro·gram Quad·Q], for
solving quadratic equations [it would show all work (Dang hard to do!)
, and give the final answer])].
  I took the basic knowledge of the GetKey (or GetKy on the TI-85/86),
and his ideas for extras (the clearing of the screen with [clear],
exiting with the [exit], et cetera) and added them in using simple
If statments.  In his note, he (Sean) said that he could not get it to
display the code (or KeyCode, see program name and quote) for [clear].
The solution for this is simply the location of the If statement:

Stuff not shown in example	...
Loops while 1=true (forever) 	:While 1
"->" represents the StoreAs sym :GetKy->O
If GetKy=[Clear] then clear scrn:If O==45:ClLCD
Display KeyCode			:Disp O
If GetKy=[Exit] then Return	:If O==22:Return
Loops to /from ":While 1"	:End
Quits program execution and	:Return
 returns execution to calling
 program, or EOS, Equation
 Operating System.

Put the "If O==45:ClLCD" before the ":Disp O" as so the screen will
clear, then display the KeyCode for [Clear], instead of it displaying
the code, then clearing the screen, which makes it awfully hard to see
the code before the screen clears, seeing how fast the TI-86 is).

Oh, by the way, as so you do not have to rely on a program to tell you
the code for each and every key you want to use/scan for in a program:
the codes are arranged in an R1C1 format (the Row# first, then the
Column#).  The first key on a TI-85/86 is [F1]/{M1}.  Its Row# is 1 and
its column# is 1, so the code would be the concat of 1 and 1, or 11.
[F2]/{M1} would be Row1, Column2, or 12.  [2nd], Row2, Column1, or 21.
The only exception to this is [On], which has no code, or if it does,
TI says it does not, it would be impossible for it to register in a
program, seeing as it breaks the program execution immediately.  If it
does have a code, it would be Row10, Column1, or 101.

Some of the symbols used in the beginning of the program, telling the
name of the program, the quote, and the creator, myself, are not to be
found anywhere on the TI-85/86.  To get them (they are useable text
characters), check out my program ESym.  "Other & System Symbols not
Otherwise Avail"
