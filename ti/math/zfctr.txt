	I can't tell you how much I HATED factoring numbers in math! Those factor 
trees take forever! So, I made this program that allows you to input a number 
and then displays all the factors of that number in a list format.
Unzip the zip file to a directory of your choice and then load the Graphlink 
software. Send zfctr.86P to your calc and then run it. The program will prompt 
you for a number. After you input a number to be factored, the calc will think.  
When it is done, it will display a list with all the factors of that number. 
This program, being basic, is kind of slow when you factor large numbers, so be 
patient. Enjoy!
