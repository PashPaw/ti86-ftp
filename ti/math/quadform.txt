quadform
--------
This Program is one of the most efficient quadratic formula solvers. All you
have to do is enter in A, B, and C and the program will give you the anwers
to the equasion, the vertex, and it will graph the equasion if you tell it
to. It is also a very small program.

The best of luck with QuadForm, fell free to change it as needed.

QuadForm was designed by Adam Schultz, an 8th grade student at
Kimpton Middle
School in Ohio.
