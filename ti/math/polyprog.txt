QUAD is just your basic quadratic formula solver.  It displays the 
quadratic equasion simplified, whether the answers are real or 
imaginary, and the answers.

POLYDIV devides a polynomial of whatever power you want by a 
binomial.  If you want to chose the powers of both polynomials, 
or multiply any 2 polynomials, check out polydiv2 and polym in 
the ti85 section of TI's archive.
