prtgraf

This is Prtgraf.86p.  You give it a function, a starting value, and an ending
value, and it graphs the functin just between those numbers. This way you can
look at just "part" of a function. Unfortunately, you're trading the ablity
to not see the part of the function that you do not want to see for the
ability to trace it; since the function is just drawn on the graph with the
xyline command, you will not be able to trace it.
