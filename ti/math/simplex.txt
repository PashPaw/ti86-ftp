SIMPLEX ALGORITHM on the TI86

Three programs are provided to implement the SIMPLEX ALGORITHM on TI 
calculators;  SIMPLEX,  XSIMPLEX,  and  XSIMCFG. After the programs 
are installed on the calculator, the Tableaux Matrix, T, must be 
entered either directly or by the matrix editor.  Three examples will 
be used to illustrate the Tableaux in different cases.  Since these 
algorithms use the "Big M" method, the Tableaux must be constructed 
accordingly.

Example 1:
             Maximize:       Z = 3x + 5y     
             Subject to:          x <  4                        
                                 2y < 12                
                            3x + 2y < 18

With the introduction of slack variables, the resulting Tableaux is

                        1  0  1  0  0   4
                        0  2  0  1  0  12
                        3  2  0  0  1  18
                       -3 -5  0  0  0   0

Remember: the Tableaux must be entered into the calculator with the 
objective row (last row) as the FIRST line of the matrix, i.e.:

		T = [[-3 -5  0  0  0   0]
		     [ 1  0  1  0  0   4]
		     [ 0  2  0  1  0  12]
		     [ 3  2  0  0  1  18]]


         
The solution may be obtained by running the program SIMPLEX.  The TI86
display will be:

                        Z = 36
                        {2 6 2 0 0}

The maximum value for Z will be  36  when the objective variables, the
first two entries in list L, take the values  x = 2  and y = 6.  The 
values for the three slack variables are also included in the list.  
The Tableaux may be viewed by recalling matrix T to the screen.  The 
entries are rounded to 4 degrees of decimal precision.  This value may
be changed by editing the 'round' line in the program.  If desired, the
matrix entries may be converted to fractional form by pressing [2nd] 
[MATH] MISC [MORE] >Frac.

If the student would prefer to step through the solution process from 
one Tableaux to the next then the following procedure should be used:

Enter the Tableaux matrix, T, as previously described.  Now, instead 
of running  SIMPLEX,  run XSIMPLEX. The next Tableaux will be computed
and displayed.  The cursor keys can be used to scroll through the 
resulting Tableaux.

                       -3  0  0  5/2  0  30
                        1  0  1   0   0   4
                        0  1  0  1/2  0   6
                        3  0  0   -1  1   6

If the Tableaux has negative entries in the top row, press  [ENTER]  
to run  XSIMPLEX  again.  Continue pressing  [ENTER] and scrolling the
resulting matrix until the Tableaux is in the final form.  The 
resulting values for Z and the objective variables may be read directly
from the matrix T.  The matrix entries will be shown in fractional form 
but the fractional entries may be viewed by recalling T to the screen.

Example 2:
        Maximize:       Z = 3x + 5y     
        Subject to:          x      <  4                        
                                 2y < 12                
                            3x + 2y = 18
                                

With the introduction of an artificial variable to account for the 
equality, the resulting Tableaux is

                        1  0  1  0     0   4
                        0  2  0  1     0  12
                        3  2  0  0     1  18
                       -3 -5  0  0  1000   0

1000  is added to the objective function to mark the column containing
the artificial variable as per the "Big M" method.  When  SIMPLEX is 
run the result is as before:

                        Z = 36
                        {2 6 2 0 0}

These entries may be rounded or changed to fractional form (if 
necessary) by recalling variable Z or list L and performing the 
desired transformation.  To step through the solution process, we must
now run  XSIMCFG  once initially to configure the Tableaux and enable 
it to handle the Big M.(1000).  Then run  XSIMPLEX  repeatedly until 
the Tableaux is in its final form.

Example 3:
        Minimize:       Z = .4x + .5y   
        Subject to:         .3x + .1y < 2.7                     
                            .5x + .5y = 6       
                            .6x + .4y > 6

With the introduction of a surplus variable to account for the greater
than or equal to in the last equation, the resulting Tableaux is

                        .3  .1  1     0   0     0  2.7
                        .5  .5  0     1   0     0  6
                        .6  .4  0     0  -1     1  6
                        .4  .5  0  1000   0  1000  0

1000  is added to the objective function to mark the columns containing
the artificial variables as per the "Big M" method and  -1  marks the 
surplus variable. The problem has been transformed from a minimize 
problem to a maximize problem by taking the negative of the objective 
function.  When SIMPLEX is run the result is:

                        Z = -5.25
                        {7.5 4.5 0 0 .3 0}


Since we started by taking the negative of the objective function we 
must now take the negative of  Z  to obtain the actual minimum value  
5.25.

To step through the successive Tableaux we must first run  XSIMPCFG  
to configure the Big M's and then repeatedly run  XSIMPLEX  as in 
Example 2.
