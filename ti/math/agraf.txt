This is the newest verions of Agraf.86p.  Basically it starts up with a
menu that looks like the TI-86 graph menu, but some of the letters are
in lowercase so that you can tell the difference between the program and
the actual menu. When you press [  F1  ] for "y(x)=" it allows you to
enter a function, store it to y1-y5, and then chose from the preset
TI-86 Graph Styles.  Special thanks to Grath Johnson who let me borrow
some of the ideas from his advgrah program for agraf.85p, which is in
turn the inspiration for agraf.86.
