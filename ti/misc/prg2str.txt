prg2str
-------

This program makes it simple to transfer a program from the
TI-86 to the TI-85 without using a Personal Computer.

Note:  Will not transfer ASM programs!

This utility will convert a program on the TI-86 to a
string which can then be sent to the TI-85 as a string.
The string can be easily converted back to a program on
the TI-85 using the RCL feature from within the program
editor.

There are two programs included in this utility:

PRG2STR.86P:  user friendly TI-basic program
which requires P2S.86P

P2S.86P:  ASM module to do the conversion


Step by Step procedure:

1.  First you must un-tokenize the program to be sent.
The TI programs are tokenized (condensed) just before
execution. The only time a program is un-tokenized is
when you enter the program editor.  It remains
un-tokenized until the next time you execute it.

2.  Execute the program PRG2STR.  After answering yes to
the question "Have you un-tokenized the program?", you
will enter the name of the program to convert to a string.

3.  When the conversion is complete the original program
will be unchanged and PRGS will be the string with the
program in it.

4.  Connect the TI-85 to the TI-86.
Select LINK/RECV on the TI-85
Select LINK/SND85/STRNG on the TI-86 and select PRGS for
send.  XMIT the string.  (see TI-86 operation guide)

5.  On the TI-85 enter the program editor using the name
you want the program to have.  From within the editor on
the TI-85 select [2nd][RCL]PRGS.

6.  Now you must delete the quotation mark at the beginning
and the end of the program on the TI-85.  Be sure to
remove any commands from the program that are not valid
for the TI-85 (for example DelVar).

7.  When you are sure that you have the program on the
TI-85 you should delete PRGS on both calculators to save
memory.
