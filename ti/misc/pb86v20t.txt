Introduction
============

PhoneBook/86 is a program designed to keep track of your most important phone
numbers.  It is fairly limited so it isn't intended to replace any kind of
pocket electronic organizer, or address book, but it helps by providing you
with the most used numbers.

Things added to this version
============================

You can skip this section if you hate literature. :)

TI-85 (Phone Book 85, duh! hehe) :)
0.9b:
Unreleased version, only 6 records maximum hold.  This version was so small and
so limited that I never found a bug in it. :)

1.1 (TI-85):
The search engine has been corrected so that you can do coninuous searching
instead of stopping on the first match and not letting you to keep searching.

1.5 (TI-85 version):
New GUI with mouse like point and click operations!
In the record viewing screen, you now have the option to jump to the first and
last records from any where instead of having to scroll all the way to them.

2.0 (TI-85 version):
Finally!  Now you can store up to 4 different Memo files.  This is very useful
for those hard to understand math formulas and history tests! ;)

2.1 (TI-85 version):
Fixed small bug in the multiple memo engine which caused all of the files to
be erased, even when selecting just one for deletion.  Program code optimized
to be more compact (only about 2kb where regained by this).  Other minor bugs
fixed and eliminated.

TI-86 (I finally got mine last night - 9/29/97)
1.0 (TI-86's first port):
Same as PB85 v2.1.  Minor changes to the user interface and work on GUI
optimazation to release v1.1 might start in a few days to a week.  I just got
my
86 last night, so I'm working on ways to make the GUI faster than the one used
in
the 85 version of the program, since I noticed the 86 is slightly slower when
it
comes to TI-BASIC code. :\  No complains about ASM programs though. :)

1.1 (TI-86 version):
The 'View Records' engine optimized a little bit, not much difference though,
but
the speed is now almost equal of that from the TI-85 version.  The menus for
the
'Enter/Erase record' file selectin options have been changed, and this truly
helped the program in both speed optimization and usabilty, as you can now go
back
to a previous menu instead of having to renter either one of the option screens
again.

1.2 (TI-86 Version):
Several things changed in this version, one of the most important changes is
the fact
that all 'system' variables used by the program only during execution are now
delete
when you exit, thanks to the 86's new command DelVar( which wasn't available on
the 85
to my knowledge.  Another change in this version is the way it manages
available/erased
records.  In versions 1.1 and earlier, this was done by setting a value of
either
1 (available) or 0 (erased) to a REAL variable who's name was 3 letters
corresponding
the record file letter(e.g. AAA - the avilable/erased identifier for File A).
The result
of this were a really long and unecessary list of variables that would be
really annoying
to the user when scrolling through the calc's MEM DELETE menu, not to mention
overall
calc sluggish performance.  In version 1.2 however, this "tecnique" was
substituded by a
LIST variable 'PBfiles', which has 20 separate numbers in it, and as you
might've already
guessed, each # consist of either a 1 or a 0, and, each # corresponds in order
to each of
the record files (e.g. 1st - File A, 2nd File B..,20th File T).  And one last
thing that
was corrected, the SEARCH engine was a mess, I had wrong labels everywhere, now
this has
been corrected.  This will probably be the last version I release for a while,
since it
seems pretty stable, and my SAT is in 2 days and I really need to study. :\  So
I really
hope you enjoy it! :)

1.5 (TI-86 Version):
This is a major version release, since there are alot of changes, non which
were due to
bugs of any kind (1.2 was a very stable version).  First of all, the PBfiles
list
variable now has 22 elements, the extra 2 elements are program execution
variables and
the purpose is to maintain as little as possible the list of variables used by
the program.
All of the string variables used to store DATA now use a different name system,
now instead
of using 2 character file names (e.g. A1, A2, A3 for the record File A) the
program uses
file names which are more organized and easier for the user to identify if
files are to be
shared or deleted from the calculator (PBa1, PBa2, PBa3 for the record File A).
The search
engine no longer requires you to scroll back to the first record prior to
entering a search
string, now you can do searching from anywhere.

1.5b (TI-86 Version/Experimental version[in house]):
A few small bugs fixed.  Also, the program should feel slightly faster now that
I changed
certain things all around the code.  The program now switches the calculator to
default
modes used by the progam, so now the user doesn't require to reset the defaults
before
running PB/86.  Also the graphics database is saved and restored before
entering the program.
The name was changed to PhoneBook/86, since this is going to be the new name
format I will
be using to name all of my future TI-86 applications under the name of iMageX
Software.

2.0/2.0t (TI-86 Version):
New distribution of PB/86 which includes a non-GUI version (PB86t), which saves
some space
on the calc, plus runs faster!  Of course, the GUI version is still there, for
those of you
who prefer looks over productivity. :P  When you exit PB/86, it now saves the
current record
file position for the 'View Records' screen (About time, uh? hehe).

Features
========

-Easy to use graphical menu system with mouse like pointer.
-*NEW* Text menu interface version, faster, less memory consumption.
-Stores up to 20 names with phone numbers and a short description for each.
-Easy scroll through records using function keys.
-Record functions thru an EDIT menu.  Includes record entry, directory, record
 erase, and search functions
-Quick Memo feature for storing up to four 6 line by 21 character memos.

How to use
==========

  PhoneBook/86 was designed to be self explanatory and easy to use and
understand, however,
I shall explain and describe each of the functions included.

  The group files PB86v20(t).86G have two program files in it, PBINST and
PB86(t).
The first one being the installation utility, and the second PB/86 itself.  You
need to run PBINST if you are running PB/86 for the first time, or if you want
to quickly erase all data you have previously entered.  After running PBINST
you can proceed to execute PB86(t), and when you do so the first thing you will
see is the title screen followed by a screen that will show a graphical menu
with four different options, or a text based menu with 5 menu items divided in
the
following way:

GUIv: +---------------------+  TEXTv: +---------------------+

      |---------------------|         |  F3 - Edit Menu     |
      |  MEMO    |  QUIT    |         |  F4 - Help          |
      |          |          |         |  F5 - Quit PB/86    |
      +__________|__________+         |----|---|---|---|----|
                                      +---------------------+

  To select an option just move the pointer to the screen in which the option
is located and press the 2nd (yellow) key, or press the corresponding function
key, F1..F5, for the text menu version.

  The View Records option will bring you a screen like this:

                                +---------------------+
                      NAME ---->|John Doe             |
                                |                     |
              PHONE NUMBER ---->|(888)555-1234        |
         SHORT DESCRIPTION ---->|123 Main Street      |
                             +->|AnyCity, ST  50186   |
                                |                     |
               RECORD FILE ---->|File C               |
                                |_____________________|
                 MAIN MENU ---->|<-|<<- | ->>|->|Menu |
                                +---------------------+
                                 F1  F2   F3  F4  F5
                                  |   |    |  |    |
 SCROLL TO PREVIOUS RECORD -------+   |    |  |    +---- GO BACK TO MAIN MENU
      JUMP TO FIRST RECORD -----------+    |  +--------- SCROLL TO NEXT RECORD
       JUMP TO LAST RECORD ----------------+

  If you press F4 (Scroll next) you will see the next record file, in the case
above you will see record File D, and if you press F1 (Scroll previous) you
will see the previous record file, in this case record File B.  Notice that
it works like a loop jumping back to the first record if you select next while
in the last, and to the last if you select previous from the first.  If you
would like to quickly jump to either the last or the first record you can do
this by pressing either F2 for the first or F3 for the last.  "No data" will
always be displayed for those records that have no data.  F5 (Menu) will bring
you back to the main menu.

  The Edit menu is used to manage your record files.  If you select to go to
the Edit menu it will show you the following:

GUIv: +---------------------+  TEXTv: +---------------------+
      |_____________________|         |    PhoneBook/86     |
      |----------|----------|         | by  iMageX Software |
      |ENTER NEW |  RECORD  |         |F1 - Enter New Record|
      |  RECORD  |DIRECTORY |         |F2 - Erase Record    |
      |---------------------|         |F3 - Record Directory|
      |  ERASE   |  SEARCH  |         |F4 - Record Search   |
      |  RECORD  |____      |         |F5 - Back            |
      +__________|BACK|_____+         |----|---|---|---|----|
                                      +---------------------+

  Entering new data requires for the selected file to be empty, this is done
with the Erase option.  When you select Enter New Record, you will be presented
with the following menu sequence for selecting the desired file to enter data:

   +-------------------+      +-------------------+
+---------------------+
+->| A | B | C | D | E |<MORE>| F | G | H | I | J |<MORE>| K | L | M
|More|Stop|
|  +-------------------+      +-------------------+
+---------------------+
+---------------------------------------------------------+             |    |
            +---------------------------------------------|-------------+    |
            |  +-------------------+      +----------------------+           |
            +->| N | O | P | Q | R |<MORE>| S | T |Memo|Back|Stop|-+         |
               +-------------------+      +----------------------+ |         |
                                                     |             |         |
                         +---------------------------+             |         |
                         |  +--------------------+                 |         |
                         +->| M1| M2| M3| M4|Back|->Edit Menu<-----+---------+
                            +--------------------+

  Select the letter coresponding to the file you wish to enter data in by
pressing the F key corresponding to the menu item.  When you select a file it
will show a prompt asking for a name, a phone number, and then a short
description for the record entered.  Something like this:

Name
>
Phone #
>
Description
>

You enter the desired data on each of the prompts.  Notice that on the last
menu of the sequence you can select Memo which will let you enter data on any
memo file. (WARNING: This will not check if you already have data on any memo
file, so it is recommended that you check the current data to see if it isn't
anything important)  If you select a file with data on it it will tell you
so and you will have to erase it prior to editing it.  Back will bring you
"back" to the first menu (A,B,C..), and Stop will bring you back to the Edit
Menu screen.

  The Record Directory option will let you see which files contain data and
which are empty, this by displaying the record file letter on the left side
and the name you designated to the record on the right.  If the file is empty
it will display "Empty" on the right side instead of a name.  This is useful
when going to enter new data to see which files are empty instead of guessing.

  The Erase option will bring you a menu sequence identical to the one to
Enter data.  Select from the menu which record file you want to erase and if
it contains data it will ask you if you are sure.  Obviously selecting 'Yes'
will PERMANENTLY erase the data on the selected record.  Selecting 'No' will
bring you back to the Edit menu.  If there was no data on the file selected it
will tell you that the file is 'Already erased'.

  The Search option let's you search by name for a specific record.  This
function is case sensitive, so if you enter JOHN to look for John Doe's record
it will not find it, you have to use exact case, in this case John not JOHN.

  The Back option will exit back to the Main Menu.

  Back in the Main Menu, the Memo option will show you the Memo files you have
entered thru the Edit menu.  Select any of the "F" keys corresponding to the
memo file you wish to view (the default is always M1), or choose F5 (Menu) to
go back to the Main Menu.

  And last, but not least, Quit will exit the program.  You can also exit by
pressing the EXIT key.

Tips, Bugs, etc.
================

  Remeber that the selection button used in this program is the 2nd (yellow)
key
so don't try using anything else, it was made this way to help with the
standard
often used in games in which the 2nd key is used to simulate a game pad between
the cursor arrow keys and the 2nd key area.  Also, do not press any other key
than the ones used while in the Main or Edit menus, this will cause the pointer
arrow to disappear and the next time you move it will creat a "ghost" arrow
where
the old one was.  If this happens, simply press that key again without moving
the
pointer first, and it will redraw the arrow and the ghost won't appear
afterwards.
On the graphical menus(Main/Edit), if you click in the area of the title bar
you
will be presented with a quick help screen for the corresponding menu.  Before
transferring PB/86 to your calc, I recomend that you either reset the memory,
or
that you at least set to the default modes and you get rid or unselect any y#
variables (EQU's for the GRAPH menu).  If you need to share files with anyone
else
or if you want to back up your existing files, simply copy the desired record
file group of files (e.g. PBa1,PBa2,PBa3 - File A), to the other calculator
with
PB/86 and make sure to edit the list PBfiles on the destination calc so that
the
1st # in the list is 1 (for File A), or the corresponding # of the record file
transferred, and to back up all of your existing files, transfer all of your
record files plus the PBfiles list to a group file using the TI-GRAPH Link.

  Another useful tip is, when entering someone's 'Description', you can type up
to
21 characters for the first line, and then continue typing more info right
after
the 21st character, without adding a space, this will make that 22nd character
appear as the 1st character of the next line on the screen.
          |                     |
Example:  |Description:         |    Use the space character on your calc
untill
          |>123 Main Street     | <- the cursor reaches the 2nd space under the
          | City, ST  12345     |    2nd line.

============================================
Before I go, just a few favors I want to ask:

Please, if you do modify this program, notify me of the modifications and
leave my name at least in a little corner on the screen somewhere in the
program.  Also, feel free to send any comments, suggestions, or any other kind
of criticism directly to my email address.

And last, but not least, please let me know as soon as you get the program
if you liked it and if you plan to use it, because depending on the feedback
I get I will consider future versions.  Also, if anyone is interested on
making a port on ASM, let me know ASAP, that would be a really neat idea and
alot of people have been emailing me about an ASM version of PB, still I'm
not that kind of programmer, yet.

I hope you enjoy using the program as much as I enjoyed programming it!  Trust
me, 1900+ lines worth of TI-BASIC code sure is a lot of work, so it wouldn't
be good for me to know some one didn't like it! ;)  Well, have a good time
keeping track of phone numbers!
