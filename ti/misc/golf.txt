"Golf" is a score keeper for 9 or 18 holes of golf. What
the program does is adds up the number of strokes and putts of the golfer and
after the 9 or 18 holes are finished it displays the number of strokes, putts,
overall total, and the par of the coarse so you can compare your total with
the par of the coarse.
