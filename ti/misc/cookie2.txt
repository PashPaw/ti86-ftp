Fortune COOKIES version 1.1
  By Jerome Azbell

A great fortune cookie program for the TI-86.  There are 10 fortunes.

Coming soon: (hopefully)

If I find time, Fortune COOKIES for TI-83 and 83 Plus.
Fortune COOKIES version 1.2 is sure to come out.
And, permission pending, I may even make a program out of ABC's
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"
