Introduction, Features, and Information
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Introduction
----------------------------------
Organizer 86 is a program for use on the Texas Instruments
Graphing Calculator model "TI-86."  The program efficiently
stores large numbers of 'listings,' which consist of names,
phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other information.  The
program has a multitude of features which is unmatched by
any other program for the TI-86.  Organizer 86 is powerful
enough to meet your demands, and remains easy to use.


Features
----------------------------------
UNLIMITED STORAGE.  The program itself has no limit as to
how much data can be stored, the amount of data that can
actually be stored is determined by the amount of free
memory on your particular TI-86. Organizer 86 only uses
memory it needs, and frees up memory when information is
erased, just like a real computer!

ONE PROGRAM FILE.  Unlike some other programs on your TI-86,
to run Organizer 86, the ONLY program file needed is
entitled "ORGANIZE".

DATA PROTECTION WITH A PASSCODE.  Organizer 86 allows you to
disable viewing of data, or to convert the data to read-only
status, and allows you to set your own personal passcode.
See the "Special Organizer 86 Utilities" section later for
exact details.

MEMORY CHECK.  Need to know how much memory your data is
taking up?  No problem!  Organizer 86 will check to see how
much memory is being used.

ERROR CHECK.  Did you let your not-so-talented friend borrow
your calculator?  Did your calculator take a fall?
Organizer 86 scans your data for errors... and then proceeds
to automatically fix any problems it finds!

ALPHABETICAL STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL.  Organizer 86 organizes
listings by the first letter of the last name or by company
name, and allows you to retrieve listings by letter as
well... and all this is done automatically!

AND THERE'S MORE!  Get started with Organizer 86 and see how
it lets you easily store and retrieve data, edit data, erase
data, and much more! You'd never think something like this
was possible on a TI-86!

Information
----------------------------------
Organizer 86 was developed over a period of six months.  It
was designed from the first line of programming code to be
"right the first time."  It was created by Mark W.
Zvolensky, a computer science student at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  If you have any comments regarding
this program, you are encouraged to send e-mail to
markzvo@netscape.net as your input is appreciated.



======================================================

Getting Started with Organizer 86
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Installing Organizer 86
----------------------------------
FIRST, you must run the program entitled OINSTALL.  This
will start Organizer 86 and install the necessary files.
The install program will inform you that by running the
install program more than once, you will erase any Organizer
86 data that is already stored.  To prevent this from
happening, erase the installation program 'OINSTALL' as soon
as it has finished installing Organizer 86.  For information
on how to erase programs, see your TI-86 owner's manual.
The install program will automatically start Organizer 86
for you.

//////////////////////////////////////////////
>>>>>  STARTING ORGANIZER 86 FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL TAKE 5-10 MINUTES.

Running Organizer 86
----------------------------------
	When Organizer 86 begins, you will see a screen that says
"Welcome to Organizer 86;" "Choose VIEW to see current
listings or choose INPUT to enter new listings."  At the
bottom of the screen, there are 5 menu options:

	VIEW: This allows you to view listings that are stored in
memory.
	INPUT: This allows you to input new listings into memory.
	OTHER: This provides access to special features like data
lock, etc.
	* : This provides program information.
	EXIT: This exits the program, Always exit the program by
choosing 		EXIT here, from the main program screen.

//////////////////////////////////////////////
  I M P O R T A N T    I N F O R M A T I O N
//////////////////////////////////////////////
>>>>>  IF YOU DO NOT EXIT ORGANIZER 86 PROPERLY, THE PROGRAM WILL ASSUME THERE
WAS A CRASH, AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY SCAN ALL DATA FOR ERRORS THE NEXT TIME THE
PROGRAM IS STARTED.
This can get quite annoying so be sure you always exit the
program by choosing 'EXIT' from the main program screen, if
possible.

Installation notes
----------------------------------
Organizer 86 uses one program file "ORGANIZE," one list file
"LISTINGS," and 26 string files (one file for each letter of
the alphabet) PAA, PBB, PCC, PDD, etc. These files MUST be
present to run ORGANIZER 86.  Also, when you have finished
installing Organizer 86, delete the program file entitled
"OINSTALL."

Graphing calculator!!!



======================================================

Entering Listings into Organizer 86
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Entering listings into Organizer 86 is very simple, just
start the program by typing ORGANIZE on the calculator
screen; or select it by choosing Programs, Names, ORGANIZE.
The program will start and a menu will appear at the bottom
of the screen, choose INPUT (F2) to begin. You will be
notified that last names or company names are required. All
of the other data can be skipped by entering a single
character (any letter or number will suffice). Press Enter.
Start by entering the last name or company name. If you are
entering a name listing for "John Smith," you would type
"Smith." If you were entering a company listing for "Bill's
Shoe Shop," you would type "Bill's Shoe Shop." The
company/last name must begin with a capital letter, as this
first letter is used for alphabetization.
Next is the first name field, If you are entering "John
Smith," you would type "John" here, followed by pressing the
Enter key.  If this is a company listing, skip this field by
entering a single character, followed by pressing the Enter
key.  Tip #1: To enter a listing like "J Smith," Type "J"
followed by a space, or "J" followed by a period in the
first name field.  Tip #2: To enter a company name like "The
Shoe Store," type "Shoe Store" for the last/company name,
and type "The" for the first name.  The listing will be
stored under "S" for "Shoe Store" instead of "T" for "The."
Next is the phone number field, starting with the area
code.  To skip the ENTIRE phone number field, enter a single
character, if you do not know the area code, you may skip
the area code field only by entering three zeroes ('000').
Next is the actual 7 digit phone number.  Simply type the 7
digits.  Do not enter a dash/hyphen as Organizer 86 will
automatically do it for you.
Next is the extension for the phone number (used in many
businesses). .To skip the extension field, enter a single
character.  Otherwise you may enter 2 to 5 numbers.
Next is the e-mail address, starting with the e-mail name.
If you are entering "Johnsmith44@computer.com," you would
type "Johnsmith44" here. As always, to skip the e-mail
address, just enter a single character.
Next is the e-mail domain.  If you are entering
"Johnsmith44@computer.com," you would type "computer.com"
here.  NOTE: When entering e-mail adresses, do not use the
'@' symbol, as Organizer 86 will automatically do it for you
(that way you don't have to search the TI-86 menus for this
symbol).
Finally is the 'other info.'  field, you can enter up to two
lines of information, such as street addresses, additional
phone numbers, etc.  Enter a single character to skip this
field.

The data will then be verified (if a problem arises, you
will be notified).  The data will then be displayed.  You
will have the option to save the data or clear it.  If you
choose the clear option, the data will not be saved.



======================================================

Viewing Listings with Organizer 86
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

	From the main screen, choose VIEW by pressing F1.  The menu
screen will appear.  Choose the first letter of the
company/last name by using the arrow keys.  Press the Enter
key to select the letter.  The data will load, 6 listings at
a time.  If there are more listings, you can advance to the
next 6 listings by pressing the Right directional key.  Use
the up and down keys to select a listing that is on the
screen.  Press Enter to select the listing.
	The listing will be displayed.  At the bottom of the
screen, five menu choices will be presented:
	EDIT:  This will allow you to edit the current listing.
	NEXT:  The next listing for the current letter will be
displayed.
	OK:  This will return you to the main screen.
	LIST:  This will return you to the list for the current
letter.
	ERASE:  This will allow you to erase the current listing.

NOTE: If the data is locked, you will not be able to view
(or input) any listings.  If the data is set to read-only,
the EDIT and ERASE menu options above will not be available.



======================================================

Modifying Listings with Organizer 86
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Editing Listings
----------------------------------
Times change.  So do people's e-mail addresses and phone
numbers.  So... how do you change this information in
Organizer 86?  Simple.  To edit an existing listing,  make
sure that your data is unlocked.  Then view the listing you
wish to modify by choosing the VIEW option from the main
screen.
	When you completely load the listing, you should see EDIT
at the bottom of the screen.  If you do not see this...
choose OK and unlock your data (See the "Special Organizer
86 Utilities" section later for instructions regarding
unlocking data).
	The DATA FIELD EDIT will appear and will remind you that to
erase a data field, enter a single character.  With data
field edit, you can remove data, change data, or add new
data. After pressing Enter will be given the four data
fields to select from: Name, Phone Number, E-Mail address,
or Other Information.  You will also have the option to
cancel.  Select the data that you wish to modify.
	Just as if you were inputting a new listing, enter the
data.  When you are done press Enter and the data will be
verified.  If the new data is accepted you will be asked to
save the changes.  Choose yes to save.  NOTE: Any changes
you make WILL NOT be saved unless you choose 'yes' when
asked to "Save editied Changes."

Erasing Listings
----------------------------------
To Erase data, view the listing that you wish to erase. Be
sure that your data is completely unlocked, otherwise the
'ERASE' option will be disabled.  Simply choose 'ERASE' from
the menu below.  You will be warned that erasing data is
permanent.  You will be given the chance to cancel 3 times,
otherwise, if you proceed through the 3 warnings, the single
listing will be permanently erased.  To erase ALL of the
listings, see the "Special Organizer 86 Utilities" on the
next page.



======================================================

Special Organizer 86 Utilities
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

	To access the utilities below, choose "OTHER" from the main
program screen.  You will be shown a menu with the utilities
below to select from.  Use the up and down arrows to select
a utility, then press the Enter key.  Or, to exit this
utility selection menu, press the EXIT key.  In addition,
some utilities may not work if the data is locked (see
below).

Lock all data
----------------------------------
	Locking all data prevents data from being erased, edited,
or even viewed within Organizer 86.  You will be asked if
you would like to set a passcode, choosing NO will lock the
data, but to unlock the data, no passcode will be needed.
Choosing YES will allow you to enter a passcode containing 4
to 6 numbers (the program will not allow you to use anything
except numbers).  You will have to enter the exact same
passcode twice, just to make sure you didn't make a
mistake.  Your passcode will be checked, if everything is
acceptable, the data will be locked and you will be returned
to the main screen.
NOTE:  Locking data and making the data read-only (see
below) only works within Organizer 86.  External calculator
functions still have full access to the raw data files.

Make data read-only
----------------------------------
Making the data read-only is essentially the same as locking
the data except the data will be able to be viewed.
Erasing, editing, and inputting new data will not be
allowed, however.

Unlock all data
----------------------------------
	This will unlock all data regardless if it was locked or
read-only.  If a passcode was used, you will be prompted to
input it.  If no passcode was used, the data will be
unlocked and you will be returned to the main screen.

Erase ALL data
----------------------------------
	Do I really need to tell you want "Erase ALL data" does?
This function will not work if the data is locked or
read-only. You will be warned 3 times and given the chance
to cancel.  The final warning is a "countdown."  You can
press any key before the countdown is over to cancel the
delete.  If you do not press any key to stop the countdown,
the data will be erased, letter by letter from A-Z.
NOTE: The countdown itself does not erase data... Data will
only be erased after the countdown concludes.

Check memory usage
----------------------------------
	This utility will check how much memory is used by the
listings stored in Organizer 86.  The final memory count
ONLY includes the listing data used by Organizer 86.  To see
how much total memory is free on the calculator, see your
TI-86 owner's manual.  The memory check usually takes about
one minute.  After the memory is displayed, the number of
listings stored for each letter will be displayed.
Following this, the total number of listings stored by
Organizer 86 will be displayed.

Error check data
----------------------------------
	This utility is, by far, the most intensive portion of
Organizer 86.  This utility scans every single character of
listing data to make sure it is correct... if it is not
correct, the problem will be fixed.  There are some very
important details to know about this utility.  They are:

//////////////////////////////////////////////
  I M P O R T A N T    I N F O R M A T I O N
//////////////////////////////////////////////
>>>>>  ERROR CHECKING DATA MAY TAKE ANYWHERE FROM 1 MINUTE TO OVER 3 HOURS!
This depends on how much data is stored, and how many errors are encountered
that require fixing.

//////////////////////////////////////////////
  I M P O R T A N T    I N F O R M A T I O N
//////////////////////////////////////////////
>>>>>  IF YOU DO NOT EXIT ORGANIZER 86 PROPERLY, THE PROGRAM WILL ASSUME THERE
WAS A CRASH, AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY SCAN ALL DATA FOR ERRORS. This can get
quite annoying so be sure you always exit the program by choosing 'EXIT' from
the main program screen.

ERROR CHECKING SOLVES MOST, BUT NOT ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS!
Error checking will only correct problems if all 26 data
files (string files PAA-PZZ) are present on the calculator.
Also, it is possible that data will 'PASS' the error scan
tests, and still cause the program to crash with "ERROR 04
DOMAIN."  You are more likely to get struck by lightning
than to have this happen, however.

ERROR CHECKING MAY CHANGE YOUR DATA!  Error checking may
have to modify your listings in order to correct them.  You
are warned of this be fore scanning.

STOPPING THE ERROR CHECK UTILITY BY USING THE "ON" KEY WILL
CAUSE THE ERROR CHECK TO COMPLETELY START OVER.  If you stop
the error checking function, it will automatically run again
the next time you start Organizer 86!

	The error check utility scans the data files letter by
letter.  There are three tests it performs on the files,
HEAD & TAIL, LIST ENTRY, and DELIMITERS.  If everything is
OK, 'PASS' will be displayed.  If a problem is encountered,
'FAIL' will be displayed.  If a 'FAIL' is displayed, the
problem will be fixed and the scan for that letter will
start again.  So it is possible that the data may be scanned
multiple times.  The error scan WILL NOT advance to the next
letter until all three tests show a 'PASS' result.
	When error checking concludes, you are notified that you
may have to use the EDIT function to further correct the
listings, as the data may receive changes during the error
scan.



======================================================

Solving Problems With Organizer 86
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

On rare occasions, Organizer 86 may encounter some
problems.  The questions and answers below are here to help
solve the most common problems.

NOTE: If you see -> below, that indicates the use of the
STORE key, which is right above the ON key.

::::::::::::::::::::

My TI-86 displays "ERROR 14 UNDEFINED" immediately when I
start Organizer 86... why?  How can I fix this?

The list file 'LISTINGS' has been deleted.  Choose 'QUIT'
and then type:   {0}->LISTINGS   and press Enter.  Start
Organizer 86 and it will automatically regenerate the
list... without the loss of any personal (string) data.

::::::::::::::::::::

Every time I start Organizer 86, I am forced to scan all
data for errors.  Why?

You are not exiting the program properly.  Do not use the
'2nd' 'Quit' option and do not stop the program by pressing
the 'On' key.  Use the 'EXIT' option on the main program
screen only.

::::::::::::::::::::

When I run OINSTALL to install Organizer 86 on my
calculator, I get "ERROR 10 DATA TYPE." Why?

There are other variables conflicting with the installation
program.  You must delete all Strings, Lists, and Variables
form your TI-86 in order to use Organizer 86.

::::::::::::::::::::

Sometimes, when using Organizer 86, I get "ERROR 10 DATA
TYPE." Why?

There is a conflict with Organizer 86.  If Organizer 86
installed correctly, then the problem is with your
variables.   First, if there is a variable of any type on
your calculator named TEMP, delete it.  If that does not
solve your problem, delete all of the REAL variables to
remove the conflict.  Organizer 86 does not need any REAL
variable data to start; it will create REAL variables as
needed.  If that still does not work, delete ALL of your
variables/files (Reals, strings, lists, programs, etc.),
except those needed to run Organizer 86 (explained earlier).

::::::::::::::::::::

Why doesn't Organizer 86 automatically delete the strings
and variables it uses when I exit the program?  Wouldn't
this save on memory?

Organizer 86 does not delete data so when you use the
calculator for other purposes... data types aren't changed.
It would slightly save on memory to do this, however,
Organizer 86 stores the minimum amount of data needed to
maintain the data type. (Yikes! Say that five times fast!)

::::::::::::::::::::

When I error check, or sometimes when I choose to view
listings, I get "ERROR 14 UNDEFINED." Now I have to error
check every time I start Organizer 86 only to get  "ERROR 14
UNDEFINED" over and over again! Why?

One or more data strings have been deleted.  Exit Organizer
86, and check to see how many strings are stored in your
TI-86 (See owner's manual for details).  There should be at
least 26 strings: PAA, PBB, PCC, PDD, etc. for every letter
of the alphabet.  If you are missing a string or several
strings, you will have to re-create the string(s). For
example, if you are missing the string for the letter K
('PKK' was not found) type:   "K"->PKK   or if you are
missing the string for the letter S, type:   "S"->PSS   .
You would do this for all of the missing files.  When you
are done, start Organizer 86 and let it perform an error
scan.  Consequently, if there are NO string files stored...
obtain the OINSTALL installation program and run it again to
re-install Organizer 86.



======================================================

Technical Information
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

STRING FILES AND DELIMITERS
----------------------------------
	There are 26 string files.  Every letter has a string file,
ALWAYS! Even if the string file doesn't have any listings
stored in it, it will still have the file content of "-".
If there are one or more listings stored in that file, the
file structure is as follows:
	Every string file starts with - and ends with -, NO
EXCEPTIONS.  This is what the "HEAD & TAIL" error check
looks for, and corrects if need be.
	One listing is divided into four pieces by the character
_.  Every listing is divided by the character -.  These
dividing characters are known as 'delimiters'.  The four
pieces (referred to as 'fields') of a listing are name,
phone number, E-mail address, and other information.  So a
string file with one listing stored in it looks like:
- [Name] _ [Phone Number] _ [E-Mail Address] _ [Other
Information] -
Note that all string files MUST start AND END with the
character '-'.
	As you may remember, you have the option of skipping or
erasing some fields when inputting data.  If a field is
designated as 'skipped', it has at least one space between
the delimiting characters. NOTE: IF THE PHONE NUMBER HAS
BEEN DESIGNATED AS SKIPPED, IT MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWO
SPACES!  If a file has more than two spaces between
delimiters, that is OK, as this indicaytes that a delimiter
was added by the error scanning utility.  For example a file
that is fully utilized may look like:
-John Doe_(789) 555-1234_JohnDoe@email.com_111 E. Paved
Road-
A file that only utilizes the name field and e-mail field
may look like:
-John Doe_  _JohnDoe@email.com_ -
NOTE: There are at least TWO spaces after the first
delimiting character ' _ ', where the phone number would
normally be located.  IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH STRING
FILES, BE SURE THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 2 SPACES BETWEEN
DELIMITERS FOR EMPTY FIELDS!
	If you are really curious, you can recall a raw string
file, and take a look for yourself. Be forewarned, they
aren't pretty!

PROGRAM LIST; filename: LISTINGS
----------------------------------
	LISTINGS is a list file with exactly 30 elements.  Elements
1-26 indicate how many listings are stored for that letter
of the alphabet.  Elements 27-30 are program settings and
SHOULD NEVER BE CHANGED FOR ANY REASON.  The list can be
verified by the error checking utility.  When you run the
wrror check utility, there is a test performed entitled
"LIST ENTRY".  The utility counts how many - characters
there are in a file, and adjusts the list to reflect that
amount.  So the list reflects the string, rather than vice
versa.
