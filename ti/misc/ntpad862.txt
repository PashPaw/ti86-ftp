Name:     Notepad Plus 86 Release 2 (Ntpad862)
Author:   Brian Creasy
Version:  1.0
Machine:  TI-86
Description:  A simple, but useful, program that uses strings to store 
     messages.

Requirements:  7279 bytes of memory

Instructions:  At the homescreen, store 788 as ABC.  Then run Ntins862
first.  This program tells you the requirements.

* to run Ntins862 in the actual program, type 0 at the prompt.

*note* - Notepad Plus 86 does not know that you have anything saved in
              a string.  If you save something in Notepad and there is 
              already something saved in the string, the old one is
              gone.

- Release 2 I made it so you can clear the saved Notes.  Also made
     it password protected.

- Release 3 is planned to be able to delete Notes completly.
