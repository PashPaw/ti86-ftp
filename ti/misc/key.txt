	Here is a little program that displays the key code of every key you 
press. I wrote it one day when I didn't have the instruction manual for my ti-86 
around me. I thought maybe someone else might find some use for it. Simply send 
KEY.86P to your calc and run it. Now, if you don't have your instruction book 
available, you can still find key codes. If you press [exit] it will display the 
code for [exit] and end. Enjoy!

Future versions:
I plan to make it so you can clear the screen by pressing [clear]. I would have 
had it in this version, but I couldn't figure out how to make it display the 
code for [clear]. (Don't expect to see this any time soon.)
