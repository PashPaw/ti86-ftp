	I can't tell you how much I hated restoring my custom menu after a battery 
removal or reseting my memory. So I made this program to do it for me. This is a 
little program I whiped up when I was bored one day. I found a program similar 
to this one, only it had some bugs in it and it filled the custom menu with 
useless items. To use the program, simply send CUSTOM.86P to your calc after a 
battery removal or reset and run it. A screen will pop-up telling you that the 
current custom menu will be erased. I only threw this in because I thought 
somebody might accidentally run it and reset their custom menu. The screen will 
prompt you to input Y or N. Obviously, you want to select Y if you ran the 
program intentionally. Once you make your selection the program will end and 
voila! Your custom menu is restored! 
	The program will fill the first 8 spaces with items and programs that I 
frequently use (such as Bill Nagel's Ashell). It is not edit-locked, so you can 
change the Lcust( command to fill the custom menu with whatever you want. And 
for all you plagarisers out there, go ahead and hack the code all you want, you 
vile heathens!!!
	Feel free to distribute this program to your friends. All I ask is that 
you keep this readme file with the original .ZIP file and that you give me some 
credit. 
	The program is free of bugs and will work properly 100% of the time. 
Enjoy!
