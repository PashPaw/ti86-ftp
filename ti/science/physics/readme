blkbody
-------
The TI-86 program, BLKBODY, calculates the radiated power emitted by a 
blackbody at a given absolute temperature as measured between two wavelengths.

forces
------
Speed up your calculations associated with gravity, electrical, and 
acceleration forces.  It will solve for any variable when the others are known.  

mass
----
This program calculates the total mass, moment about the origin of x and y, and
the center of mass of x and y, of a thin plate, given the density (either a 
constant or a function), and the upper and lower functions that bound the 
region.

relatvty
--------
This program will work out the equations of Einstein's Special Theory of 
Relativity. It also has Einstein's Field Equation, the main in Albert 
Einstein's general Theory of Relativity.

specrel
-------
This program covers all of the topics generally covered in a sophomore Physics 
course on Special Relativity apart from collisions. Requires both specrel1.86g 
and specrel2.86g.
