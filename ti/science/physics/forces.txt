forces
------

I wrote this program during my high school physics class to speed up my
calculations associated with gravity, electrical, and acceleration forces.  It
will solve for any variable when the others are known.  The masses are in
kilograms, charges in Coloumbs, distance in meters, force in Newtons, and
acceleration in meters per second squared.  This program runs on both a TI-85
and a TI-86.  One other thing, I'm not responsible if for some reason it makes
your calculator explode or something similar and you can edit it all you want.
