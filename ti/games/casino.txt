Casino for the TI-86
by Ray Kremer
includes: BlackJack, Poker, Slots

I know, not another blackjack, but I've tried all the others
and MINE IS THE BEST.  Here's why:  it uses a 52 card
virtual deck for realism, it allows doubling down and
splitting pairs and dealer blackjack insurance, it
automatically chooses 1 or 11 for aces, it shows you the
dealer's hole card after the game, it lets you choose how
much to bet, it creates a minimum amount of variables to
clutter your RAM, and it is self-contained using no messy
subprograms.  Plus, your money is saved in between games! 
If you win a fortune and come back later, the fortune is
still there.  My poker and slots are equally impressive. 
This is the last casino suite you'll ever download!
