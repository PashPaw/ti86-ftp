SQUARES is a program organizer with SQUARES programs in it.  To run
SQUARES, type "SQ" at the home screen on your calculator.

Notes:

Pick-a-Number is a game where you guess numbers and the calculator says
"HIGHER" or "LOWER".  When it says "Number range," you have to say the
maximum number.  (The minimum number is 1.)

Bounce is a simple game where you have to bounce the ball using the left
and right keys to move your paddle.

Catch is another simple game where you have to catch the ball using the
left and right keys to move your bucket.

Graphic-Jam is a useless screen saver.  Something to watch when you're
bored.

NotePad is a quick and easy way to take notes.

Shopping Center just advertises other TI-86 and computer programs.
