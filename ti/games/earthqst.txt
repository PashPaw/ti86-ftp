Earthquest v1.01
By Jordan Shapiro
mrcoolness@p3.net
Made for the TI-86

Object- The object of the game is to get 150 points so you
can disable a nuclear bomb that is set to destroy the world.
You do this by cleaning things and getting points. You can
buy more tools to help you clean, but you may run out of money.
To get more money, you have to petition different people, and 
you will be awarded if they grant your petition. The plant is 
the easiest to fight, Congress is the Hardest.
