	This is a shooting game where you have to shoot the other player
by entering velocity and angle. It includes 1- or 2-player mode (the
calculator is pretty stupid at shooting you) and wind. There are
pictures of people (or a person and a calculator in 1-player mode). To
run the program, run shoot. The other programs are just subroutines.

	Things to maybe include in new releases:
	A smarter calculator!!!
