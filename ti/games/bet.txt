1> Introduction


	Here is a little program I started way back in my freshmen year of high 
school. Everybody that I knew with a TI-86 was making betting games in basic. 
They would send them to my calc and I would play them for about two days before 
I got bored. The programs were okay. They had a lot of bugs and error messages. 
	I decided to start writing my own program where you bet on a coin toss. 
Whenever I write a program, I never release to the public until it is 100% bug 
and error free (unlike some programmers I could mention). I worked on Bet for 
about a week and a half. After backing it up to my computer, I got bored and 
decided to delete it from my calc, promising myself that I would finish it 
later. I worked on it off and on for about a week more. When I finished version 
1.0 I distributed it to as many people as I could with a TI-86. Then I forgot 
about. 
	One day in summer, I was browsing through the many 86 files on my computer 
when I found this tiny little program called bet.86P. I loaded it to my calc and 
ran it. Almost Instantly I remembered what it was. It was only version 1.0 so it 
had some bugs in it and it would occasionally give an error message. On top of 
that it took up quite a bit of memory (2043 bytes). 
	I unprotected the program and sent it back to my calc so I could begin 
upgradeing it to version 2.0. 

============================================================================


2> Installation


	After you download the ZIP file to your computer, open it with Winzip or 
some sort of archive program. In the archive there should be two(2) files:

	bet.86P			The actual program
	bet.txt			The file you are reading right now

Extract bet.86P and/or bet.txt to a directory of your choice on your hard disk. 
Once you have done this, open the TI-Graphlink software and connect the TI-
Graphlink to the 9 pin serial port in the back of your computer (The port is 
very easy to find). 
	Now, in the Graphlink software, click Link>send on the menu bar. A window 
titled "Send files to TI-86" should appear. Switch to the directory with the 
contents of the ZIP file and send bet.86P to your calc (the installation process 
should take no more than thirty seconds to one minute depending on the speed of 
your computer).

3> Game play


	Once the game is on your computer, press [PRGM]+[F1]+ the corrosponding 
"F" key for the game. The game will take a little longer to load the first time, 
so be patient. Once the title screen comes up, it will display the name if the 
program and the copyright information. Press [ENTER]. Next, it will display how 
much money you have. Press [ENTER] again. After this, the main menu will appear. 
The "F" keys are the primary keys in the game. Although, occasionally, you will 
need to use the number pad and the [ENTER] key. The main menu will explain which 
"F" key does what. But just in case, I will explain it:

	F1- Play the game
	F2- Instructions
	F3- Game stats (how much money you have)
	F4- About the program
	F5- Quit to TI-OS

F2 through F5 are pretty self-explanatory so I will just explain F1. All I will 
say about F2 through F5 is that all you do is press [ENTER] after one of those 
keys. I don't think I really need to explain F5.
	When you select F1 the screen will clear and it will display how much 
money you have and prompt you to input a wager. If you try to input a numbet 
less than or greater than the amount of money you have it will display a special 
message and wait for you to press [ENTER]. Once you press [ENTER] it will take 
you back to the wager screen. 
	When you make your bet, the screen will clear again and display "1=Heads 
2=Tails" at the top and prompt you for a response. Once again, if you input a 
number out of range it will give you a special message, wait for you to press 
[ENTER], and take you back to the choice screen.
	When you make your choice the screen will clear again and display the WIN 
or LOSE screen. This screen is the status of the particular bet you made. It 
displays Number you bet on, the number that was the outcome, and your new 
balance. When you press [ENTER], it will take you back to the main menu. 
	Continue the steps above until you run out of cash or you top $1,000,000. 
Enjoy!

============================================================================


4> Troubleshooting


	I perfected this game on the TI-86 with ROM v1.3, although, I am confident 
that it will work properly on all versions of the TI-86. The game is completely 
free of bugs, will never display TI-86 error messages, and will run 100% of the 
time. 
	I have edit locked the program, so all you plagerisers out there can't 
take credit for yourself. If you do expierience problems with your copy of the 
game, send me a  letter via e-mail with your e-mail address and the problem you 
expierienced and I will send you a new copy free of charge.
	See the Contact Information below for my e-mail address and/or fax number.

5> FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions)


	I only have a few FAQ's because not many people question my software. Here 
they are: 

Q: Whenever I try to load the game through the program menu, the screen doesn't 
do anything. Why?
A: Turn the calc on, moron.

Q: Whenever I try to look for the game in the program>names menu, I can't find 
it. Why?
A: Load the program on the calc, dummy.

Q: Whenever I press the [ON] button, nothing happens. Why?
A: Try putting batteries in, retard.

Q: Whenever I make a wager and pick a number to bet on, the calc says "YOU 
LOSE!!!". Why?
A: This one is just too easy...

6> Version history


	Version 1.0-
		Lots of bugs and TI-86 error messages. Took up almost 2050 bytes. 

	Version 2.0-
		Fixed variable bug. No TI-86 error messages. Cut down size by about 
1000 bytes. Start out with more money.

	Future versions-
		Probably not for awhile. The game is pretty much perfect as it is. 
Although, I will take suggestions from e-mail.

7> Thank you's


	There are not a whole lot of peaple I would like to thank. But if I have 
to name them they would probably be my friends and fellow TI users for 
encouraging me to upload this game, Bill Nagel for his famous ASE (I use ASE 
v1.3), And my teachers for boring me to death in class. Well, THANKS!!! ENJOY 
THE PROGRAM!!!
