nim
---
I've made a game for the TI-86 called "Tisthammerw Nim," taken from the game 
nim.  If you've never heard of nim, don't worry, I'll explain it. 
 
The game called "nim" is thousands of years old, and I'm a little surprised 
why it isn't at least as popular as tic-tac-toe, especially since there can 
never be a tie in this game. 

Anyway, the game consists of four rows of sticks in this 
configuration: 

                       | | | | | | | 
                         | | | | | 
                           | | | 
                             | 
 
The object of nim is to not take the last stick.  On your turn you pick one 
row (only one) and then take as many sticks as you want from that row (but 
you must take at least one). 

My video game allows you to play another person or the calculator.  The 
calculator features six levels of difficulty.  Instructions and program info 
are built into the program.  The game is 7295 bytes, but I think the 
somewhat large size is worth having the game. 

I hope the game proves fun with those who play with it.
