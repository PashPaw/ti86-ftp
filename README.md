# ti86-ftp
Archive of files from TI's FTP server for the TI-86 graphing calculator.

No, I don't have anything for the other calculators, sadly.  Considering that the 83/84 is still supported, those shouldn't be too hard to find.  I actually didn't get my hands on a 84 until after TI apparently shut down their FTP server.

As per my instructions on archive.org for this:

>>> You will need the following in order for transferring files onto a real TI-86 on a modern system:
>>> 1. The Silver GRAPH-LINK cable for USB.  TI doesn't appear to make these anymore but they do seem to be easy to find still.
>>> 2.  TI Connect 4.0 on Windows.  TI Connect CE won't work since those are for the 83 and 84 family. TI Connect 4.0 may work on Mac still but I haven't tried it on macOS Mojave yet.
>>> 3. A TI-86 (obviously)!.  The included files won't work on the 83 and 84 family of graphing calculators.
