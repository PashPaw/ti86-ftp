# ti86-ftp
Archive of files from TI's FTP server for the TI-86 graphing calculator.

No, I don't have anything for the other calculators, sadly.  Considering that the 83/84 is still supported, those shouldn't be too hard to find.
As per my instructions on archive.org for this:

>>> You will need the following in order for transferring files onto a real TI-86 on a modern system:
>>> 1. The Silver GRAPH-LINK cable for USB.  TI doesn't appear to make these anymore but they do seem to be easy to find still.
>>> 2.  TI Connect 4.0 on Windows or TiLP on Linux.

An update, as of 22-Jun-25:

These will run under an emulator.  Also, connecting a real TI-86 to modern Windows is finicky.  It requires patience.  It requires using Device Manager to uninstall the drivers that Windows installs by default.  Install, or reinstall, TI Connect again if necessary.
